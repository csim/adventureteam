<p>Hi, I am Clint. I&#39;m a technology enthusiast, <a href="http://www.cartoonstock.com/directory/s/software_engineer.asp">software developer</a>, father, husband, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun">cajun</a>, worrywart and sometimes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_the_Grouch">&quot;grouch&quot;</a>. I live in the suburbs of Seattle where I watch <a href="http://www.lsusports.net/">LSU football</a> and enjoy our annual crawfish boil. I have 2 daughters which leaves me as the only man in the house. Even the dog is female.</p>

<h2>work</h2>

<p>I have worked in the technology consulting industry for roughly 15 years as a software engineer and architect. Much of my career has be devoted to Microsoft, building business applications that help to keep the wheels turning in Redmond.</p>

<p>I started out in the early days of the World Wide Web (remember that?!) when Mosaic and Gopher were all the rage. In college I discovered that I could write PERL scripts on my school account and have those run over the web. I was hooked! I quickly became addicted and that started the career that I have today. I got a web development job during college and that later turned into a software consulting career.</p>

<p>I worked for many years as a generalist doing Classic ASP, ColdFusion, ASP.net and SQL server. I later focused on platforms, spending a few years doing custom application development with SharePoint and most recently working with Dynamics CRM. </p>

<p>In my spare time, I&#39;ve built a bunch of <a href="#projects">side projects</a>. Most are toys that I have used to feed my coding addiction. Some are useful and others aren&#39;t. I had fun building all of them. </p>

<p>If you are interested in more information about my work, <a href="/resume">take a look at my resume</a>.</p>

<h2>play</h2>

<p><img src="/images/crossfit_afro.jpg" class="pull-right img-responsive img-rounded" style="width: 200px; padding-left: 20px;" /></p>

<p>Outside of work I love guitar, golf, football and being a dad to my 2 daughters. <a href="http://cajunjourneymen.com">Hiking is also a passion</a>. I ran <a href="/2011/07/01/first-marathon-complete">my first marathon</a> on June 26, 2011 in a time of 4 hours and 55 minutes.</p>

<p>My most recent addiction is <a href="http://games.crossfit.com">Crossfit</a>. After about an 18 year hiatus from organized physical activity, I started Crossfit in July of 2011. For the first 3 months I proceeded to try my hardest but constantly felt like a used dish towel. I stuck with it and I have seen huge improvement in my physical fitness level. Although the path is difficult, I would not change a thing.</p>
